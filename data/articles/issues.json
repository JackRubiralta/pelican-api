With the help of playbooks and even a few love stories, the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco Forty-Niners was recorded as the most-watched Super Bowl of all time. It was also the first Super Bowl to be held in Las Vegas, a fitting location given the game itself was projected to be a gamble between two evenly-matched teams. Indeed it was, as it became the second game in Super Bowl history to go into overtime with a playing time of 74 minutes and 57 seconds."

When Annabella first received the news that she qualified for Worlds, she was so shocked that she thought it was meant for another person. Taking place in April, \u201cWorlds provides an opportunity to meet intriguing people with differing opinions from across the globe,\u201d says Lucas. In addition to the competition, both are going to be on the lookout to see a koala and a kangaroo. As we approach the spring term, wish the two debaters luck as they set off across the globe."
