With the help of playbooks and even a few love stories, the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco Forty-Niners was recorded as the most-watched Super Bowl of all time. It was also the first Super Bowl to be held in Las Vegas, a fitting location given the game itself was projected to be a gamble between two evenly-matched teams. Indeed it was, as it became the second game in Super Bowl history to go into overtime with a playing time of 74 minutes and 57 seconds."

Many may cite getting ready with friends, taking pictures, or the dance itself as their favorite part of the experience. However, when a well-themed dance comes along, creating the outfit is my personal favorite. I'm a proud member of SNL, and a huge perk of being a part of the planning process is knowing the theme weeks before everyone else. I always get a head start on finding something to wear. "

For StudCo dances, it's a lot easier to find something to wear when you're under the constraints of formalwear and a simple theme like \u201cBlack Tie.\u201d However, with SNL dances, themes require a little more thinking. My process for concocting outfits for those is a little bit more complex. "

For the patriotic dance this fall, I started by knowing I'd wear an American flag-print boxing robe. From there, I searched for inspiration on Pinterest and eventually decided upon eagle wings and a Nicki Minaj flag tied around my neck like a cape. Casual, I know. I also like to use the app \u201cShuffles\u201d to make something of a vision board for my outfits. That's where I add the accessories and something incorporating my signature star. I triple-check to ensure everything will arrive on time to avoid a crisis and send it around for approval. "
