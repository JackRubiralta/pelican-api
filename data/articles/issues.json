With the help of playbooks and even a few love stories, the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco Forty-Niners was recorded as the most-watched Super Bowl of all time. It was also the first Super Bowl to be held in Las Vegas, a fitting location given the game itself was projected to be a gamble between two evenly-matched teams. Indeed it was, as it became the second game in Super Bowl history to go into overtime with a playing time of 74 minutes and 57 seconds."

Ready for Purdy's handoff, NFL Offensive Player of the Year Christian McCaffery started at running back, and with just over four minutes left in the first half, McCaffery received a pass at the 26-yard line to clench the first touchdown of the game, putting the 49ers up by 9."

Usher, StudCo, The Dean of Students Office, and Mrs. Giles): Things started to heat up at halftime as 49ers fans began to feel confident, anticipation for a special announcement grew, and eight-time Grammy Awards winner Usher took the floor. Although Usher didn't perform the millennial classic \"DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love,\" he did not disappoint. The \"My Boo\" duet with Alicia Keys was a hit, though controversial, and the ambiance of the performance definitely made us all say Oh. My. Gosh."

The Chiefs got off to a shaky start, fumbling a pitch with Mahomes throwing an interception shortly after. It was back and forth in an exciting 4th quarter. The last few minutes provided some nail-biting moments (as the media teams captured in the skyboxes) when the 49ers kicked the go-ahead field goal to go up 19-16 with 1:53 to play in the game.  Mahomes and Kelce went to work and marched all the way to the 49ers' end of the field, setting up Harrison Butker\u2019s 29-yard field goal to tie the game up with 3 seconds left."
