With the help of playbooks and even a few love stories, the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco Forty-Niners was recorded as the most-watched Super Bowl of all time. It was also the first Super Bowl to be held in Las Vegas, a fitting location given the game itself was projected to be a gamble between two evenly-matched teams. Indeed it was, as it became the second game in Super Bowl history to go into overtime with a playing time of 74 minutes and 57 seconds."

Lauren explains that \u201cdespite the challenges of the burning sun and difficulty of the labor, [the woman] is determined to survive and persevere through the struggle.\u201d She brings this story to life through her choreography, which initially starts with an empowering and emotional mood, eventually transitioning to something hopeful and bright. Matteo Lorenzo-Giguere \u201825 set an exciting, bold piece that diverges from typical classical ballet. He wanted to \u201csubvert the St. Paul\u2019s community\u2019s expectations of what ballet could be\u201d and expose more styles of ballet to the people at St. Paul\u2019s. The hyperpop music inspired Matteo to choreograph his piece to match its powerful energy with fast and athletic steps. Another piece, by Lulu Mangriotis \u201825, is emotional and communicative between the dancers and with the audience. Lulu says preparation was essential in her choreographic process. She would create choreography in her room and \u201ctake it to the dancers and see how they took it,\u201d saying that \u201cshe ha[d] no idea what to expect and ended up with a wonderful piece.\u201d Olivia Van Stone \u201825 created a piece with a strong dynamic, varying in formations and pace. She describes the style as \u201csharp and brisk,\u201d and the piece's mood builds up from start to finish, complementing her music.
