In actuality, though, a perfect March Madness bracket has never been accomplished. The odds of winning vary on how much basketball you know, but an average fan has a 1 in a 120 billion shot of a perfect bracket. The odds are so stacked against having a perfect bracket that Warren Buffett offered $1 billion to anyone in his firm to achieve it. Although skill can play a factor in how well your bracket does, there is no way really to predict every upset without blatant luck. So, don\u2019t feel bad if your bracket flopped in the first game."
