Far from being a disorganized jumble, MISH is a delightful spring celebration thoughtfully organized by our Missionary Society, which also lends its name to the event. MISH, an acronym enveloped in as much tradition as the celebration itself, signals an unexpected pause from the rigorous demands of academic and athletic pursuits during the Spring Term.
