Oohs and ahhs could be heard amongst the SPS crew as the sight was beautiful. The sky went dark and the air grew cold. Everyone observed the bright white light from the Sun\u2019s corona during complete totality and could distinctly make out looping solar prominences emerging from the corona.

He was reading a book by the campfire when two young women stumbled onto the campsite. They were \u201cclearly lost, soaking wet, and terrified at finding a large human such as himself in the middle of nowhere.\u201d The women were dehydrated and exhausted, so he fed them pre-packed chili and gave them dry clothes and blankets. In the morning, he woke them up before dawn, made them oatmeal and coffee, and then heroically led them out of the forest. When Inzer reached the trailhead, he was surprised to be met with a crowd of search and rescue personnel, state police, local police, and Fish and Game officers, all of whom were preparing to rescue the two women who had been lost.

The School had three main wings jutting off of one common room, one off each side, and one extending off the rear of the building. It was similar in function to the modern-day Coit, as while the second and third floors housed student living, the bottom floor held areas such as the student common room, dining rooms, and common spaces. As for student living, the rooms in the School were known as \u2018alcoves,\u2019 as they were all in one shared space, with three walls per alcove, leading to an open-aired student living area. Of note is that before the School\u2019s destruction, the faculty house attached to the building was moved and preserved, and it still stands today."

But snow is not the only thing that has made this April crazy In fact, it feels like we havent even had a whole week of school yet. In between revisits, the solar eclipse, and college visits, April has been hectic. While the snow is melting and we wait for the tree outside Schoolhouse (fondly named Hum Tree) to grow its blooming flowers, we have an essential message for you all."

Maybe we are getting a bit too emotional, or maybe its just the stench from the bus bathroom getting to our heads, but being stuck on this bus for eight hours has truly been a bonding experience. With no cell service and ample time, we were forced to meet people outside of our close circles. Lesson here: traffic is a blessing and a curse because Ford and Nash now share a special connection from the experience. There are members of Nash who we will now see on the paths and recognize."
